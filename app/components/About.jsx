            About Me
          </h2>
          <p className='mt-4'>
            Hi there! üëã I&apos;m Saim, a software developer with a unique
            background combing software development, civil engineering, and
            project management. After spending over 3 years in the civil
            engineering industry, getting really good at problem-solving and
            managing diverse projects, I made the leap to Full-Stack Software
            Development in 2023 to pursue my passion for all things tech. I
            thrive on diving into new challenges and keeping up-to-date with the
            latest in technology. My drive comes from making cool stuff and
            solving real-world problems. Let's collaborate and create something
            amazing together!
          </p>
